# Background and motivation

I have been coding for over 12 years now, the first half of that time period
has been focused on building quick and dirty solutions for me or members of
my team to use in analyzing market fundamentals data in excel, using VBA. I
found my edge in the markets using my technical skills and my ability to
analyze and process more information more quickly that the "other guy".
Times continually change, and now I have found my edge using the more recent
analytical developments in machine learning and AI, while taking advantage of
larger scale computing and storage through the cloud.

I have created this site to showcase the work I've done (and continue to do),
while hopefully helping some people along the way during their analytical journeys.
Even though the specific trading and consulting applications of my work need stay
private, expressing these techniques and general approaches on varying datasets
will still prove effective at displaying my capabilities and helping others.
