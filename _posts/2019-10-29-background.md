# Background and motivation

I have been coding for over 12 years now, the first half of that time period
has been focused on building quick and dirty solutions for me or members of
my team to use in analyzing market fundamentals data in excel, using VBA. I
found my edge in the markets using my technical skills and my ability to
analyze and process more information more quickly than the "other guy".

Times continually change, and now I have found my edge using the more recent
analytical developments in machine learning and AI, while taking advantage of
larger scale computing and storage through the cloud. Well supported open-source
data science packages in Python and R have changed the game, allowing people
with various development skill levels (like me) to utilize the algorithmic
solutions of cutting-edge research teams across the globe.

I have created this site to showcase the work I've done (and continue to do),
while hopefully helping some people along the way during their analytical journeys.
The farther I get down my path, the more I'm recognizing the pivotal role
technical blog posts have had on my ability to apply concepts I've learned in
books or research papers to the real-world. Now I'd like to pay it forward.

Even though the specific trading and consulting applications of my work need
stay private (for obvious reasons), displaying the techniques and general
approaches I've discovered on various datasets will still prove effective.
