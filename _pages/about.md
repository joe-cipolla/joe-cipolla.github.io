I'm a senior data scientist who excels at sculpting data
and machine learning solutions to address real-world problems.

My professional experience has primarily been focused on trading
in the energy industry, specifically US power and gas.

I love to create and learn new things, and the continued
pursuit of perfect practice of my craft.
