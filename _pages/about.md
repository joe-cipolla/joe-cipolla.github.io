I'm a senior data scientist who excels at sculpting data
and machine learning solutions to address real-world problems.

My professional experience has primarily been focused on
price prediction and trading automation in the energy industry,
specifically US power and gas.

I love to create and learn new things, as well as the continued
pursuit of the perfect practice of my craft.
